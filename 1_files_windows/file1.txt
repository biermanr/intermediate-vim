welcome to file1.txt!

if you got here from following the directions in the README.md
then you should have two tabs. 

This isn't a large file, but let's pretend we wanted a vertical
split window for some reason. We can do C-wv. Then we can switch
to the new window on the right with C-wl.

Now try switching back to the README.md tab by using gt (next tab)
(go ahead and do that now)

Ok, you should be back here again. I think that's enough messing around.

Let's clean up the windows here with C-wo and then let's clean up this tab
by just using :q as normal
