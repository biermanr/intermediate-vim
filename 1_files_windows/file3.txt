Welcome to file 3

If you got to this file by issuing the `vi -W commands.txt file3.txt`
then vim is currently listening to everything you're typing!

How about as a little exercise, try to fix this next paragraph
using as few commands as possible:

    Here's a tyypo, I think it's the only one in this paragraph,
    but there are some entire words that shouldn't be present REMOVEMEPLEASE.
    Also I meant to write the word 'and' instead of 'but' when I
    write that vim is interesting but cool.
